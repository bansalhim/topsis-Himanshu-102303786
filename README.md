# Topsis-Himanshu-102303786

This Python package implements the TOPSIS method for Multi-Criteria Decision Making.

## Installation

```bash
pip install Topsis-Himanshu-102303786
```

## Methodology and Learning

### Methodology

1. Implemented the **TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)** method in Python.
2. Created a **Python package** with modular code and uploaded it to **PyPI**.
3. Built a **Streamlit web app** to make the TOPSIS process interactive for users.
4. Verified functionality using sample datasets and validated ranking results.
5. Published the entire project on **GitHub** with clear documentation and screenshots.

### Learning

- Gained hands-on experience in **Python packaging, versioning, and PyPI distribution**.
- Understood the complete lifecycle from **code development → package publishing → GUI creation**.
- Learned how to handle **Git & GitHub for version control** and collaboration.
- Improved understanding of **decision-making algorithms** and **data handling with Pandas & NumPy**.
- Learned to deploy and test Python projects in different environments (VS Code, Colab, and Streamlit).
